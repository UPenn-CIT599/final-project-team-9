We are Team 9 and our project was recreating a BrickBreaker game. The game is a single player game that has a layer of bricks that are arranged in 
rows with a goal to destroy the bricks with a ball. The ball moves around the screen bouncing off of a paddle, the top, and two sides of the screen. 
When the brick is hit, the ball bounces back and the brick is destroyed (the strength of the brick determines how quickly the brick is destroyed). 
There are three difficulty types to choose from and each difficulty has three levels. The game continues until all bricks are destroyed at each level 
or the ball falls below the paddle a total of three times. 

Muizz Mullani worked on creating the bricks, methods to display the bricks in a randomized view, adding sound to the gameplay, updating the score and 
high score calculations and helped pull the different classes together. 

Jacob Dwyer worked on creating the paddle, creating the GUI to display the main menu and the gameboard, and helped pull the different classes together.

Raheel Bhimani worked on creating the ball, helped pull the different classes together, and documentation of code comments and review of DRY, cohesive principles. 

For the first two weeks, the project workflow stemmed from working on the class designs together and then we individually programmed our workloads. 
Over the course of the following two weeks, team working sessions were held three times a week for a minimum of two hours each in which the different 
components were brought together. 

In between the working sessions, we tested and troubleshooted the game, game flow, and continuous loop. Further, we met with our TA, Ben, on a weekly 
basis to provide updates and receive feedback, which we incorporated throughout our project.
